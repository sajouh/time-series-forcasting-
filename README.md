# time-series-forcasting

Disclaimer: This data has been extracted from an udemy times series analysis in which I was enrolled: [https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wci/](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-time-series-data-analysis/)

The data is a seasonal time series data of California Hospitality Industry Employees. The objective is to analyse the data to identify trends, seasobality and noise. Ultimately, the project is designed to have a model which captures these attributes accuartely and can forecast 12 months (1 year) into the future. 

For building the model, the data is split into train and test components. Upon evaluation, if the results are acceptable the model is adapted for the entire data-set and applied to forecast future unknown data.
